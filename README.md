# Internship Task

This repository contains the code and resources for an internship task focused on image processing and text extraction using machine learning models.

Image analysis App is a robust and efficient pipeline for image analysis that integrates object detection, text extraction, and object summarization using state-of-the-art machine learning models. This pipeline is designed to streamline the processing of visual data, making it useful for a variety of applications such as automated image annotation, content analysis, and more.

## Introduction

Image Analysis App is a comprehensive pipeline that leverages cutting-edge deep learning models to perform complex image analysis tasks. By integrating advanced techniques in computer vision and natural language processing, This approach is capable of detecting objects, extracting text, and summarizing visual content efficiently and accurately.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses pretrained YOLOv8, to detect and annotate objects within an image.
- **Text Extraction**: Utilizes EasyOCR, built with powerful foundation models, to accurately extract text from detected regions.
- **Object Summarization**: Applies FuseCap, a vision transformer-based model, to generate summaries for each detected object.
